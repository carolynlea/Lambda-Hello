Hello, my name is Carolyn.

Three words that describe me are ornery, odious, and outrageous. They all begin with 'O' like Orca! I love orcas. They love to gobble up penguins. How delightful is that? I do have a husband and children and they are all hideous in their own ways, but gosh, not one of them is an orca!

My greatest dream is to have a tiny garden. But my dream doesn't stop there! I, of course, would also build a huge fish tank surrounding my tiny garden to raise a pod of orcas of my very own. Ooh la la! And I would feed them all the penguins they could ever want! What a wonderful life that would be...

A sudden thought just occurred to me. If I could lead an army of orcas, then I could lead any beast from the sea. I'll become Neptune reincarnated! The world will become my oyster! Bahahaha!  Bahaha! Bah! Kuh - uh <coughing fit> No, I'm okay. Really. Ignore the <insert life threatening disease here>. I'm good!
